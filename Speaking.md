It's funny, a lot of people say they'd like to be Michael Jordan for a day or for a week, but let them try to be Michael Jordan for a year, see if they like it. 

It's funny, a lot of people told me they'd like to be Michael Jordan for a day or for a week, but I don't think you can see the true Michael Jordan for just a day. 

It's funny, a lot of people say they'd like to be Michael Jordan for a day or for a week, but I don't think they quite understand it's no fun. 

I think what people don't realize is that from the moment Michael Jordan leaves his hotel room, the spotlight is on him. Everybody in the world wanted to see him, talk to him. They all wanted a piece of him in some way or another. He was under pressure to be "on" all the time with people. Given his hectic schedule, before a game, he would sit down for five minutes, ten minutes with a terminally ill child. He made the kids feel like they knew Michael Jordan. On top of that, he had to perform. He knew that everybody, for every game, was there to see him. After the game, he has ten minutes in the locker room to cool off, and then a room full of media. Even when he's done with the interviews, you still had the hanger-on people that would come up to him. It was like a flock of bees around honey, trailing him down the hallway. Then you get back to the hotel, another large group of people. I wouldn't want to be like Mike. It's an impossible task.  

I am ready for getting out of this life. You know when you get to that point. I'm there. And with no reservations at all. I'm there.

My fame was. It was good at the beginning. Any time people talk about you in a positive way, yeah, it's great to hear those comments, but now that you are .. on a pedestal, it's not just the positive talking that you hear. You hear some points and some people **taking shots at you**, that really changes the whole idea of being out there for people to see you. You wanna get behind those closed doors so people don't know you as much. I'm at that stage in my career and my life that I'd rather get behind closed doors than to be out there in the spotlight to be taking shots from everyone that really don't know you as a person. If I had the chance to do it all over again, I would never wanna be considered a role model. It's like a game that's stacked against me. There's no way I can win.

Do you wanna become a celebrity? 



I think most young people once dreamed of becoming a [体育明星, 歌手]. But I don't think what they really like that lifestyle. Michael Jordan once said, "It's funny, see if they like it."  Are you ready for ? Can you stand some people who really don't know you as a person keep taking shots at you?  privacy ?
